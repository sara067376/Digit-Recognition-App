# Digit Recognition App

This is a simple **Digit Recognition App** using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The app uses a pre-trained model to predict handwritten digits. The interface is created with **Streamlit** to make it interactive and user-friendly. The app can be used to predict digits from a drawn image of a number.

## Features
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Interactive user interface with Streamlit
- Predicts digits from images

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Keras** (for the digit recognition model)
- **TensorFlow** (for the machine learning model)
- **Streamlit** (for the user interface)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)

## Installation
